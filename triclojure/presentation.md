# About Me

???

- So who am I and why am I talking about interactive art?
- Senior Backend and Systems Engineer here at SB.
- The Systems part means that I used to be an Embedded Engineer, so I'm very comfortable designing
  circuits and coding in C for really, really small computers.

???

- I'm also the maintainer of Fraqture, our open source art platform written using Clojure's Quil
  library paired with Arduino.
- Fraqture was conceived of for the Durham Storefront Project which helps empty windows in downtown
  Durham find art to be displayed in them. We pitched them the idea of a digital billboard that
  would take content and glitch it.
- Once we had our initial idea accepted, we worked over the course of 6 months or so to build what
  you see here: a platform with a 50" TV, 540 LEDs, a forward facing camera, and a live twitter
  stream that feeds it content to manipulate.
